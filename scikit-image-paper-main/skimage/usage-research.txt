Often, a disproportionately large component of research involves dealing with
various image data-types, color representations, and file format
conversion. scikit-image offers robust tools for converting between image
data-types ([DirectX]_, [OpenGL]_, [GraphicsGemsI]_) and to do file input/output
(I/O) operations.  Our purpose is to allow investigators to focus their time on
research, instead of expending effort on mundane low-level tasks.

The package includes a number of algorithms with broad applications across
image processing research, from computer vision to medical image analysis. We
refer the reader to the current API documentation for a full listing of current
capabilities [APIdocs]_. In this section we illustrate two real-world usage
examples of scikit-image in scientific research.

First, we consider the analysis of a large stack of images, each representing
drying droplets containing nanoparticles (see Figure :ref:`cracks`). As the drying proceeds,
cracks propagate from the edge of the drop to its center. The aim is to understand
crack patterns by collecting statistical information about their positions,
as well as their time and order of appearance. To improve the speed at which
data is processed,
each experiment, constituting an image stack, is automatically analysed without
human intervention. The contact line is detected by a circular Hough transform
(``transform.hough_circle``) providing the drop radius and its center. Then, a
smaller concentric circle is drawn (``draw.circle_perimeter``) and used as
a mask to extract intensity values from the image.
Repeating the process on each image in the stack, collected
pixels can be assembled to make a space-time diagram. As a result, a complex
stack of images is reduced to a single image summarizing the underlying dynamic
process.

   Scikit-image is used to track the propagation of cracks (black lines)
   in a drying colloidal droplet. The sequence of pictures shows the temporal
   evolution of the system with the drop contact line, in green, detected by the
   Hough transform and the circle, in white, used to extract an annulus of
   pixel intensities.  The result shown illustrates the angular position of
   cracks and their time of appearance. :label:`cracks`


Next, in regenerative medicine research, scikit-image is used to monitor the
regeneration of spinal cord cells in zebrafish embryos (Figure :ref:`profile`).
This process has important implications for the treatment of spinal cord
injuries in humans ([Bhatt04]_, [Thuret06]_).

To understand how spinal cords regenerate in these animals, injured cords are
subjected to different treatments. Neuronal precursor cells (labeled green in Figure :ref:`profile`, left panel) are
normally uniformly distributed across the spinal cord. At the wound site, they
have been removed. We wish to monitor the arrival of new cells at the
wound site over time. In Figure :ref:`profile`, we see an embryo two days after
wounding, with precursor cells beginning to move back into the wound site (the site of
minimum fluorescence). The ``measure.profile_line`` function measures the
fluorescence along the cord, directly proportional to the number of cells. We
can thus monitor the recovery process and determine which treatments prevent or
accelerate recovery.

   cord injuries. Left: an image of fluorescently-labeled nerve cells in an
   injured zebrafish embryo. Middle: the automatically determined region of
   interest. The SciPy library was used to determine the region extent, and
   functions from the scikit-image ``draw`` module were used to draw it. Right:

   width.
