In our data-rich world, images represent a significant subset of all
measurements made. Examples include DNA microarrays, microscopy slides,
astronomical observations, satellite maps, robotic vision capture, synthetic
aperture radar images, and higher-dimensional images such as 3-D magnetic
resonance or computed tomography imaging. Exploring these rich data sources
requires sophisticated software tools that should be easy to use, free of
charge and restrictions, and able to address all the challenges posed by such a
diverse field of analysis.

This paper describes scikit-image, a collection of image processing algorithms
implemented in the Python programming language by an active community of
volunteers and available under the liberal BSD Open Source license.
The rising popularity of Python as a scientific programming language,
together with the increasing availability of a large eco-system of
complementary tools, make it an ideal environment in which to produce
an image processing toolkit.

The project aims are:

1. To provide high quality, well-documented and easy-to-use
   implementations of common image processing algorithms.

   Such algorithms are essential building blocks in many areas of scientific
   research, algorithmic comparisons and data exploration. In the
   context of reproducible science, it is important to be able to inspect any
   source code used for algorithmic flaws or mistakes. Additionally, scientific
   research often requires custom modification of standard algorithms, further
   emphasizing the importance of open source.

2. To facilitate education in image processing.

   The library allows students in image processing to learn algorithms in a
   hands-on fashion by adjusting parameters and modifying code. In addition, a
   ``novice`` module is provided, not only for teaching programming in the
   "turtle graphics" paradigm, but also to familiarize users with image
   concepts such as color and dimensionality. Furthermore, the project
   takes part in the yearly Google Summer of Code program [gsoc]_, where
   students learn about image processing and software engineering through
   contributing to the project.

3. To address industry challenges.

   High quality reference implementations of trusted algorithms provide
   industry with a reliable way of attacking problems, without having to expend
   significant energy in re-implementing algorithms already available in
   commercial packages.  Companies may use the library entirely free of charge,
   and have the option of contributing changes back, should they so wish.


Getting started
===============

One of the main goals of scikit-image is to make it easy for any user to get
started quicklyâ€”especially users already familiar with Python's
scientific tools. To that end, the basic image is just a standard NumPy array,
which exposes pixel data directly to the user. A new user can simply the load
an image from disk (or use one of scikit-image's sample images), process that
image with one or more image filters, and quickly display the results:

.. code-block:: python

   from skimage import data, io, filter

   image = data.coins()  # or any NumPy array!
   edges = filter.sobel(image)
   io.imshow(edges)


.. figure:: getting_started.png

    Illustration of several functions available in scikit-image: adaptive threshold,
    local maxima, edge detection and labels. The use of NumPy arrays as our
    data container also enables the use of NumPy's built-in ``histogram``
    function.
    :label:`gettingstarted`

The above demonstration loads ``data.coins``, an example image shipped with
scikit-image.  For a more complete example, we import NumPy for array
manipulation and matplotlib for plotting.  At each step, we add the picture or
the plot to a matplotlib figure shown in Figure :ref:`gettingstarted`.


.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Load a small section of the image.
    image = data.coins()[0:95, 70:370]

    fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2, nrows=3,
                             figsize=(8, 4))
    ax0, ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4, ax5  = axes.flat
    ax0.imshow(image, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
    ax0.set_title('Original', fontsize=24)
    ax0.axis('off')


Since the image is represented by a NumPy array, we can easily perform
operations such as building an histogram of the intensity values.

.. code-block:: python

    # Histogram.
    values, bins = np.histogram(image,
                                bins=np.arange(256))

    ax1.plot(bins[:-1], values, lw=2, c='k')
    ax1.set_xlim(xmax=256)
    ax1.set_yticks([0, 400])
    ax1.set_aspect(.2)
    ax1.set_title('Histogram', fontsize=24)


To divide the foreground and background, we threshold the image to produce
a binary image.  Several threshold algorithms are available. Here, we
employ ``filter.threshold_adaptive`` where the threshold value is the weighted
mean for the local neighborhood of a pixel.

.. code-block:: python

    # Apply threshold.
    from skimage.filter import threshold_adaptive

    bw = threshold_adaptive(image, 95, offset=-15)

    ax2.imshow(bw, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
    ax2.set_title('Adaptive threshold', fontsize=24)
    ax2.axis('off')

We can easily detect interesting features, such as local maxima and edges. The
function ``feature.peak_local_max`` can be used to return the coordinates of
local maxima in an image.

.. code-block:: python

    # Find maxima.
    from skimage.feature import peak_local_max

    coordinates = peak_local_max(image, min_distance=20)

    ax3.imshow(image, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
    ax3.autoscale(False)
    ax3.plot(coordinates[:, 1],
             coordinates[:, 0], 'r.')
    ax3.set_title('Peak local maxima', fontsize=24)
    ax3.axis('off')

Next, a Canny filter (``filter.canny``) [Canny]_ detects the edge of each coin.

.. code-block:: python

    # Detect edges.
    from skimage import filter

    edges = filter.canny(image, sigma=3,
                         low_threshold=10,
                         high_threshold=80)

    ax4.imshow(edges, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
    ax4.set_title('Edges', fontsize=24)
    ax4.axis('off')


Then, we attribute to each coin a label (``morphology.label``) that can be used
to extract a sub-picture. Finally, physical information such as the position,
area, eccentricity, perimeter, and moments can be extracted using
``measure.regionprops``.

.. code-block:: python

    # Label image regions.
    from skimage.measure import regionprops
    import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
    from skimage.morphology import label

    label_image = label(edges)

    ax5.imshow(image, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
    ax5.set_title('Labeled items', fontsize=24)
    ax5.axis('off')

    for region in regionprops(label_image):
        # Draw rectangle around segmented coins.
        minr, minc, maxr, maxc = region.bbox
        rect = mpatches.Rectangle((minc, minr),
                                  maxc - minc,
                                  maxr - minr,
                                  fill=False,
                                  edgecolor='red',
                                  linewidth=2)
        ax5.add_patch(rect)

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()


scikit-image thus makes it possible to perform sophisticated image
processing tasks with only a few function calls.

Data format and pipelining
==========================

scikit-image represents images as NumPy arrays [numpy]_, the de facto standard
for storage of multi-dimensional data in scientific Python. Each array has a
dimensionality, such as 2 for a 2-D grayscale image, 3 for a 2-D multi-
channel image, or 4 for a 3-D multi-channel image; a shape, such as $(M, N, 3)$
for an RGB color image with $M$ vertical and $N$ horizontal pixels; and a
numeric data type, such as ``float`` for continuous-valued pixels and ``uint8``
for 8-bit pixels. Our use of NumPy arrays as the fundamental data structure
maximizes compatibility with the rest of the scientific Python ecosystem.
Data can be passed as-is to other tools such as NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib,
scikit-learn [scikit-learn]_, Mahotas [Mahotas]_, OpenCV, and more.

Images of differing data-types can complicate the construction of pipelines.
scikit-image follows an "Anything In, Anything Out" approach, whereby all
functions are expected to allow input of an arbitrary data-type but, for
efficiency, also get to choose their own output format. Data-type
ranges are clearly defined. Floating point images are expected to have
values between 0 and 1 (unsigned images) or -1 and 1 (signed images), while
8-bit images are expected to have values in {0, 1, 2, ..., 255}. We provide
utility functions, such as ``img_as_float``, to easily convert between
data-types.
